    "text": "This page contains a protocol you should follow when departing QMCM. It is divided in two sections: general (for everyone) and wet lab (for people working in a wet lab).\nThis is meant not only to give you a guide about what steps you need to take and to remind you of everything that needs to be taken care of, but also to ensure that your research during your time at QMCM is not lost and can be reused and shared in the future.\nYou can also find some tips and useful information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor PhD students\n\n\n\nIf you are a PhD student, your last working day is the hand-in date of your thesis. After that day you will lose access to the building and the internal DTU systems, including your email, Teams, and the DTU drives. Make sure you reserve time to take care of all the tasks in this protocol before that day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll employees should have an exit interview with their immediate manager before their last working day. This interview is meant to receive feedback and suggestions on how to improve as a workplace. Make sure to agree on a date and time for the interview with your manager. More information.\n\n\n\nWhen you leave it is important that the data you generated is accessible to future members of QMCM, either to replicate your research or to be reused in a different project.\nIt is also important that data from publications is available and easily accessible to be sent to third parties if they request it.\nHere’s a step-by-step guide on the process you must follow for the data you generated.\n\n\nGo over all your data and decide what should be stored and what should be deleted. Remeber to check all the places where data is stored, such as local hard drives, the M drive, OneDrive and the O drive.\nBe very conservative with what you decide to keep. If in doubt, decide to keep something rather than deleting it. Also, consider asking your manager and other people in the group if they could use any of the data you want to delete.\nAll data related to a publication must be kept. For data not related to a publication, as a rule of thumb you should always keep raw data and final data, while intermediate data may be deleted (depending on the case).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBefore deleting any data make sure to consult with stakeholders. Stakeholders may include your supervisor, collaborators, or other third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nMove all the data that should be kept to the O drive. The O drive is the only accessible and backed-up storage space that will not be deleted when you stop working at Biosustain and which other members of the group can access.\nIf you have any data or lab notes on Benchling, make sure the responsible person from QMCM has access to it.\nCommit and push any changes in repositories that are local in your computer. If possible, consider uploading data files to repositories to ensure they are accessible.\nIf there is any data in a proprietary format readable only by a specific software, like raw data from an instrument, store the information in an open format if available.\n\n\n\nOrganisation can help a lot with understanding where the data comes from, what was it used for and what it can be used for in the future.\nCreate 1 folder per publication and collect all the files related to the publication in that folder. Consider also creating a compressed file with the data folder that can be sent to third parties if they request data from the publication.\nFor data not related to a publication, organise it based on which project it belongs to. Create 1 folder for each project and move all the related data there. Create a text file inside that folder that explains what the project is about, what has been done until now, who was involved in the project, what are the next steps for the project and if there are any publications.\nFiles on Teams: files you shared in Teams channels are stored in your personal OneDrive account. This means that when you leave and that account is eliminated, the file will be deleted. Make sure to back up any files “stored” in a Teams channel that should be preserved.\n\n\n\nCreate metadata for everything! Each folder that contains files should have a metadata file explaining them. This can take many forms, but as a minimum for every file there should be the following information:\n\nA brief explanation of what the file is (unless it’s obvious).\n\nHow the file was created (what software or lab protocols were used, the raw data it has been created from if it is processed data).\n\nWhen it was created (approximately).\nWho created the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nTo help decide what to include in the metadata file, think as if you were encountering all the data you are leaving from a past employee and didn’t know anything about it. What information would you need to use it? Write anything you would need in the metadata file.\n\n\nYou may write all this information in the metadata file, or you can direct to another place for the information. For example, if you have a lab notebook in Benchling that explains how some data was created you can link to it in the metadata file. NEVER direct someone to a physical object such as a paper notebook for more information. If that information is not in a computer drive on which security back-ups are regularly made, it may as well not exist. IMPORTANT: When linking to external locations (such as Benchling) or other files make sure that people in the group have access to them and that they will not be deleted when you leave.\nConsider also creating a metadata file explaining how the data is structured, and what kind of data is in every folder.\n\n\n\nGo over the data and the folders where it is stored with the person that will be responsible to continue with your projects or the data responsible for the group. Make sure with them that everything is clear and organised in a way that makes sense.\nAny questions they have about the data or folder structure should be answered by the metadata file. If they have a question that is not currently answered by the metadata file, add the information to it.\n\n\n\nThere are some important points you should think about in regards to your data. Some of these topics are:\n\nFor how long should the data be kept?\nWho is responsible for the data?\nAre there any legal agreements related to some or all the data (like GDPR contracts)?\n\nConsult with the Data Management Team at the center. They know what the legal requirements for data and can provide input to some of these topics. They should also have a copy of your Data Management Plan, where some of this information may be specified.\nOnce you have consulted with the Data Management Team, you should have a discussion with your manager. Make sure to communicate what the legal requirements for the data are and agree on the topics specified above.\n\n\n\n\nEvery employee is provided with an office setup by the IT department. This includes a laptop, mouse and keyboard, screens, a laptop charger, (maybe) a dock for your computer and (maybe) a phone. All this equipment should be returned to the IT department before you leave.\nYou may also have been using some equipment bought with the group’s or your budget. In this case, talk with your manager about what to do with that equipment, if it can be reused by another member of the group or if it could be given to the IT department. Note that all equipment is property of DTU, and you can not take it with you even if it was bought with your grant.\n\n\n\nRemove all items from your desk and any drawers you used. Make sure to leave the keys of the drawers.\nIf you have a locker in the changing rooms return the keys to reception.\n\n\nBefore your last day settle all your expenses on DTU Fusion and submit all your timecards.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis protocol is specifically made for people that work in the wet lab.\nApart from this page, you will need to store some information about samples that are being kept and ongoing projects. Fill the tables in one of the files (Excel, ODS, CSV) and then save it in your folder on the O drive with the name of the file indicating your name, initials and that it’s the information about what is left in the lab. For example: 20250626_smuyo_lab_departing_tables.csv\n\n\nIf you are responsible for any equipment, ensure that another person takes responsibility.\nPut all the protocols in the common folder in the group and ensure that they are reproducible. If necessary, show the person who will continue with the project how to perform the experiment\n\n\n\nWaste handling: Information about waste handling, waste containers, labels etc are available in the waste storage room (0. floor). If you have questions ask in the goods reception or the lab responsible person.\nAll boxes and items to be retained after you leave need to be labelled with your name/year/sample type/project name or number.\n\n\n\nDiscard buffers, LB-plates, bio-samples according to waste handling guidelines.\nGive chemicals, kits, reagents, antibodies related to unfinished projects to the person who will continue the project or to the lab responsible.\nWrite to the group and ask your colleagues to pick up what they can use (using common channels i.e. Teams).\nChemicals - discard expired chemicals, put the rest into the group´s lab collection or if no longer needed in the common chemical storage (1.floor)\nWipe down the empty shelf with soap and afterwards 70% ethanol\n\n\n\n\n\nGive relevant materials to the project successor and/or ask the group for pick-up.\nDiscard all buffers and expired chemicals according to waste guidelines.\nDiscard opened materials, everything that should usually be kept sterile (e.g tubes , serological pipettes, pipetting reservoirs etc) .\nYou can leave commonly used kits (RNA, DNA, plasmid extraction etc) and unopened, not expired items of general use at the common shelf in the 0 floor.\nWipe down the empty desk and cupboards with soap and afterwards 70% ethanol.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscard everything that is no longer needed or not in original containers (working solutions of buffers, antibiotics, redundant samples etc.)\nLeave samples that need to be retained (e.g until publication) with the project successor or in the alumni freezer (lab responsible provides a place). List in the table above what you leave behind.\nTransfer enzymes, antibiotics, chemicals, kits (not expired and still in original containers) to common lab storage\nTake the empty rack out of the freezer, let it thaw and dry before placing it back\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscard everything that is no longer needed or not in original containers.\nStrains: add all important strains (characterised, published, to be published, patent-related) to the alumni lab strain collection.\nLeave strains, biological samples etc. that will still be needed after your departure with the project successor or in the alumni freezer (lab responsible provides a place). List in the table above what you leave behind. Make sure that the physical location matches the location stated in the alumni strain collection.\nTake the empty rack out of the freezer, let it thaw and dry before placing it back.\n\n\n\n\nClear out your personal items from common laboratory storage spaces, e.g chemical hood, anaerobic chamber, mammalian cell culture, animal facility etc.\nLet project successors and lab responsible review this list to make sure there are no immediate questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to extend access to your DTU profile, including access to all the related services, you can get extensions of up to six months at a time. The extension needs to be actively requested before the employment termination date.\n\nThe employee, whose profile should be extended, must sign a non-disclosure agreement. You can find the NDA in DTU Inside\nThe immediate manager must file a request for a prolongation of an active DTU profile with CFB-HR including:\n\nThe signed NDA from the employee\nEnd date for the prolongation.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may be possible to loan your laptop for a while after your last day if you need it, but it will require signing a contract with IT. Consult with IT before you leave in case you want to keep your laptop and they will let you know the requirements and prepare any necessary documents.",

    "text": "Official PhD rules from DTU\nPhD information on DTU Inside\nGuidelines for PhDigital\nMain link for forms\n\n\n\nFocus solely on your PhD project plan for the first two months of your PhD, which has to be submitted to PhDigital at the end of the second month. The main part of the project plan is the project description and project overview as a Gantt chart (template), which can be added as a PDF attachment to the PhDigital project plan. The project description should contain working title, background based on literature research, hypothesis, objectives and deliverables, means and references. The project overview should be a Gantt chart containing all planned activities during the PhD project.\n\n\nFor the project plan, 25.0 ECTS have to be planned of the total 30.0 ECTS required to finish the PhD program. For the final submission at the end of the PhD program, the ECTS total has to be between 27.5 and 32.5 ECTS, otherwise the submission will be rejected. Keep this in mind when planning the courses for the project plan.\nThere are three mandatory courses and one mandatory workshop which every PhD student at DTU has to follow:\n\nSustainability Assessment and Communication for 2.5 ECTS points (register through the DTU course base using course number 12950, 12951 or 12952).\nSupervision and facilitation of learning for 1.0 ECTS point (register through the DTU Learning Lab).\nPhD Seminars in Bioengineering and Synthetic Biology for 3.0 ECTS (register as external course). You should attend at least 2/3 of the Friday seminar sessions (20 hours per year) and present yourself 2 times: on the second and third year (the half-way presentation counts as one when done during the Friday seminar). It is recommended that you also present in your first year.\nIntroduction to responsible conduct of research and research data management for new employees workshop (register through DTU Inside).\n\nThere are many options for allocating the remaining required ECTS:\n\nOther courses at DTU which can be found and registered for through the DTU course base.

Visit the Courses page for a full overview.\nCourses from Coursera are also allowed.\n\nWhen you want to add a non-DTU course to your project plan, a separate form with a detailed description of the ECTS activity needs to be filled out. The completed form and the course description need to be combined in one PDF file and attached to the project plan.\nYou can always add courses for approval after the submission of the project plan by adding them to your half-year reports. The registration of completed courses is done through PhDigital as well by attaching the course certification to the next half-year report and writing a note with the course name and number of ECTS that need to be registered.\n\n\n\nThe main goal of the external research stay is to experience a different research environment, so it is encouraged to go abroad. The duration of the external research stay will depend on the individual PhD project, however the average duration is three months. From three months or longer you can apply for travel grants to aid in funding the external research stay and this is also encouraged. For the project plan, you need to plan where, with whom and roughly when the external research stay will happen. Previous students have visisted different universities and companies for their external research stays, so there are many options and some examples are provided here.\n\nSystems & Synthetic Biology group of professor Lars Nielsen at the University of Queensland (UQ) in Brisbane, Australia.\nThe Systems Biology Research Group of professor Bernhard Palsson at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in San Diego, USA.\nBiosys team at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE) in Toulouse, France (contact through Anne Goelzer).\n\n\n\n\nFor the department work you have to plan up to 420 hours including a mandatory 100 hours for teaching. Both the teaching and other department work are allowed to be executed through all of DTU, not just the department as the name suggests. There is no dedicated way to find a teaching assistant position, so you have to ask around for it. Ask your supervisor, the PhD administration, other PhD students, etc. A 100 teaching hours corresponds with one 5.0 ECTS course at DTU. For the project plan specifically, you can write teaching assistant for 100 hours in the department work table. Additionally, there is a requirement to include a 100 hours of department work specifically for the DTU Biosustain PhD school. There are multiple options for filling up the rest of the department work hours, amongst others:\n\nCo-supervision of a student for their master thesis project, which can be allocated 200 hours for department work.\nStudent member of the PhD school committee, which can be allocated 140 hours for department work. Elections every year around the start of the year and you can contact the head of the PhD school if you are interested.\nParticipation in the Early Career Researcher Association activities, which can be allocated 20 - 200 hours for department work depending on your involvement.\n\n\n\n\nDissemination is anything related to broadcasting your research, ranging from conference posters and presentations to writing scientific publications. Up to 420 hours has to be planned for dissemination if your research. As an average, you can allocated 50 hours for conference participation and a poster or presentation, and 100 hours for writing and publishing a scientific article. Visit the Conferences page for a full overview of conferences.\n\n\n\nIt is mandatory to meet at least every two weeks with your main supervisor and on average every month with your co-supervisor(s).\n\n\n\n\nThe half-year reports have to be submitted every six months in PhDigital (the first must be submitted 4 and a half months after the start, after that they are submitted every 6 months) and are a measure to track your progress through the PhD. Select that the progress is satisfactory. For the “past six months” and “next six months” summaries, you can simple write a paragraph with an update or plan of your PhD activities, respectively. It is important to stay up-to-date with your half-year reports, since they have to be all submitted and approved before you can submit your PhD thesis in the end. Any changes in courses, external research stay, etc compared to the original PhD project plan, should be written in the half-year reports and will be approved accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe aim of the first-year interview is to improve both the PhD student and the PhD school. The interview is conducted by a scientific staff member serving on the PhD school committee. If this is not possible, another scientific staff member will be appointed to conduct the interview by agreement with the head of the PhD school. This interview is also your chance to talk through your PhD journey with a scientific staff member who is not your supervisor and this can provide you with very useful feedback. There is a guide available to help you conduct the interview.\n\n\n\nThe half-way presentation is due by 16.5 months of the PhD project. Two examiners should be selected to attend the half-way presentation and the (private) discussion afterwards. One examiner should be internal from the DTU Biosustain department and one examiner should be external, preferably from outside Denmark. The discussion is attended by the main supervisor, the co-supervisor(s) and the two examiners. After the discussion, the examiners will provide feedback on the progress of the PhD project to help you prepare for the second half of the PhD. The presentation is around 20 minutes and is usually done during the PhD Friday seminars, but could be done on any day and time, depending on the availability of the examiners. It can be helpful to write a short report on your progress to send out to the supervisor team and the examiners beforehand to ensure sufficient feedback during the half-way session. Such a report can focus on background, objectives, progress and publication goals of the PhD project.\n\n\n\nIt is advisable to plan the external research stay between the 12 and 30 months mark, but it can be planned whenever it makes the most sense within the PhD project. To make the most out of the external research stay, within the first year is usually a bit too early. To avoid stress towards the end of the PhD project, the external research stay is usually planned to end before the last 6 months of the PhD project. There is no minimum requirement for the duration of the external research stay, but 3 month is the optimal for most. If you are planning to work in the laboratory at the host university or company, a duration of 6 months is more appropriate. With a duration of 3 months or longer, you can apply for travel grants to cover some of the costs of the external research stay. No need to worry, the costs of flights and the accomodation abroad is always covered by the main supervisor and the PhD school. How to book flights and process the expenses upon return can be found of the Expenses and travel page. It is recommended to start the preparations for the external research stay at least 6 months prior to leave enough time to apply for travel grants, visa, etc. For accomodation, it is possible to book an apartment through Airbnb to expand your options.\n\n\nA nice overview of travel grants can be found on the travel and research stays abroad page. An overview of all travel grants that were awarded to other PhD students in the QMCM group is provided here.\n\nOtto Mønsteds Fond applied for in October 2022 and 15,000 DKK received. The deadline is 2 months prior to the start of your external research stay and the requirements for the application are: signed support letter from institution confirming their support (in addition to salary) and the extent of it, recommendation letter from the institution or supervisor, invitation from the host institution.\nChristian og Ottilia Brorsons Rejselegater applied for in September 2022 and 5,000 DKK received. The deadline is 1st of September and the requirements for the application are: application form, master’s degree, list of other grants for which you applied to, CV, recommendation letter, project description. This application has to be send by post to an office in Copenhagen.\nNiels Bohr Fondet applied for in September 2022 and 15.000 DKK received. The deadline is 1st of October and the requirements for the application are (6 pages maximum): project description including well-founded description of the object of the researcher’s stay as well as a justification for choosing this specific place to do your research (2 pages maximum), documentary proof of research location including invitation from host university (if possible), budget including information about the financing of the stay, and CV.\nOtto Mønsteds Fond applied for in March 2022 and 15,000 DKK received. The deadline is 2 months prior to the start of your external research stay and the requirements for the application are: signed support letter from institution confirming their support (in addition to salary) and the extent of it, recommendation letter from the institution or supervisor, invitation from the host institution.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe preparations for the PhD thesis submission should start around 3 months before the hand-in date, which is exactly 3 years after you started. The PhD defence should take place no longer than 3 months after the PhD submission date. All information on this topic can be found on the PhD submission and defence page.\n\n\n\nThe PhD project can be extended with 3 months and the application for the extension can be submitted to the PhD school 3 months before the original hand-in date.

There is no minimum requirement for the duration of the external research stay, but 3 month is the optimal for most. If you are planning to work in the laboratory at the host university or company, a duration of 6 months is more appropriate. With a duration of 3 months or longer, you can apply for travel grants to cover some of the costs of the external research stay. No need to worry, the costs of flights and the accomodation abroad is always covered by the main supervisor and the PhD school. How to book flights and process the expenses upon return can be found of the Expenses and travel page. It is recommended to start the preparations for the external research stay at least 6 months prior to leave enough time to apply for travel grants, visa, etc. For accomodation, it is possible to book an apartment through Airbnb to expand your options.\n\n\nA nice overview of travel grants can be found on the travel and research stays abroad page. An overview of all travel grants that were awarded to other PhD students in the QMCM group is provided here.\n\nOtto Mønsteds Fond applied for in October 2022 and 15,000 DKK received. The deadline is 2 months prior to the start of your external research stay and the requirements for the application are: signed support letter from institution confirming their support (in addition to salary) and the extent of it, recommendation letter from the institution or supervisor, invitation from the host institution.\nChristian og Ottilia Brorsons Rejselegater applied for in September 2022 and 5,000 DKK received. The deadline is 1st of September and the requirements for the application are: application form, master’s degree, list of other grants for which you applied to, CV, recommendation letter, project description.

    "text": "The submission at the end of the 3-year PhD is more than submission of the PhD thesis alone. The following documents have to prepared and submitted as well, either beforehand or simultaneously with the PhD thesis. To ensure a smooth PhD submission, the documents apart from the PhD thesis can be submitted before the hand-in date to be approved already. All documents should be submitted to the PhD school of DTU Biosustain.\n\n\nThe PhD submission checklist form has to be filled out and signed before submission together with the PhD thesis. All components of the checklist are listed below, but the checklist itself should not be forgotten.\n\n\n\nThe assessment committee approval form has to be filled out and signed before sending it to the PhD school to be approved. For the assessment committee, 3 members are required: one from DTU and two external, preferably from outside Denmark and their level should be at least assistant professor or equivalent in industry. Anyone you have collaborated and/or published with is exempt from taking part in your assessment committee. The approval form should be send for approval around 3 months before the PhD submission to allow for sufficient time for the approval, since the PhD school committee only meets once a month. It is advisable to start contacting potential assessment committee members around 6 months before your hand-in date, because it can take some time to find them. Please note that a CV and publication list of each assessment committee member are required as an attachment to the approval form.\n\n\n\nThe main chapters of the PhD thesis are usually published or unpublished manuscripts and thus require co-author statments: one per chapter/manuscript. So, the co-author statement form has to be filled out and signed separately for each chapter/manuscript with the corresponding authors. An example of a filled-out co-author statement form can be found here. Once all co-author statement forms are completed, they can be compiled into one file and submitted with the other documents for the final PhD submission.\n\n\n\nThe popular science summary will be send out with the announcement of the PhD defence, but needs to be submitted within the PhD submission.\n\n\n\nThe supervisor report goes through PhDigital and is initialised by the PhD student one month before the hand-in date. The supervisor report has to be submitted and approved before the hand-in date, so this is an important part of the PhD submission.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few guidelines to consider for the PhD thesis itself, however most of the thesis is up to the PhD student and their preferences. Generally, the PhD thesis includes 3 main chapters which can be either published articles or unpublished manuscripts, a general introduction chapter, and a conclusions and recommendations chapter. The final chapter, i.e. conclusions and recommendations, should have the specific structure of each conclusion or recommendation as one sentence in bold with a following paragraph elaborating the conclusion or recommendation. Usually, there are 2 conclusions and 1 recommendation per chapter and the conclusions and recommendations should be in the ordered after (potential) impact. It is crucial to check the guidelines of scientific journals if published articles or unpublished manuscripts are allowed to be imbedded in the PhD thesis in their original format. PhD thesis titles need to be comprehensible and enticing to a potential reader, while at the same time not being so general and vague as to obscure what the PhD thesis is about. Furthermore, titles should be concise and informative. Abbreviations and formulae should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to include a few keywords in the title to aid web-searches. The final PhD thesis should be submitted to the PhD school of DTU Biosustain and to the supervisor team. The PhD school will forward the PhD thesis to the central PhD administration, who will send it to the assesssment committee members.\n\n\nThere is no official template for the PhD thesis document, but you can adapt the general DTU report template to fit the thesis. Official DTU logos, colours and other templates can be found in the DTU design guide. Please note that the document should be set as a two-page rather than a one-page document, since the final thesis will be printed double-sided as a book format.\n\n\n\nFor inspiration on the structure of the PhD thesis, it can be useful to refer to previous PhD theses from the DTU Biosustain department. The preface section typically uses Roman numerals as the page numbering. The first page should contain the title of the thesis, the month and year of submission, author name, the copyright and the department publishing the thesis. Following this should be a page with the written approval which should be dated and signed by the PhD student. Afterwards follows the abstract, the Danish abstract, list of publications, acknowledgements, table of contents, and list of figures and tables.\n\n\n\nFor the cover, there is a template available from the DTU design guide PhD thesis section, but most PhD students produce their own cover design. The cover should as a minimum have the DTU logo in the top left corner, the DTU department in the top right corner, the title of the PhD thesis and the name of the PhD student. Please refer to the DTU design guide logo section for the appropriate use of the DTU logo, department name, etc. The cover is allowed to be any colour, but it is important to know that the spine of the printed PhD thesis can only be selected from 12 different DTU colours. So, if you want the colour of the cover to match the colour of the spine, please refer to the colour codes in the section below in advance.\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading and assessing the PhD thesis, the assessment committee will send a preliminary approval document to the central PhD administration, which will forward it to the PhD student and the supervisors. The PhD student can officially defend their thesis after a positive preliminary recommendation, submitted to PhD school at DTU Biosustain at least two weeks prior to the scheduled defence by the central PhD administration. They will get the official approval from DTU to announce the defence. The principal supervisor arranges a date and time for the defence with the members of the assessment committee and the PhD student within 3 months of the submission of the PhD thesis and must ensure that assessment committee get at least 2 months to read the thesis. The defence takes place at DTU Biosustain, where the supervisor must book the conference room R213. In case an in-person defence is not possible for a valid reason, we are open to participate online. In case of pending patents, the PhD student might be forced to postpone the defence following directions of the Businness office at DTU Biosustain and the PhD student can defend after the patent is filed. More information about the defence proceedings can be found here.\n\n\nAnnouncement by the PhD school of DTU Biosustain of the public defence (online or at DTU) via DTU calendar and in engineering weekly Ingeniøren, and together with a summary is sent to the press presse@dtu.dk. This is all taken care of and not a responsibility of the PhD student. The PhD student should find a chairman for the defence specifically, which is typically a group leader (PI) from DTU Biosustain. The chairman of the public defence should receive the checklist for the defence proceedings, the announcement send by the PhD school of DTU Biosustain, and a PDF version of the PhD thesis.\n\n\n\nThe supervisor hosts the assessment committee and coordinates the program for their stay at DTU Biosustain on the day.

Usually, the PhD students print around 40 copies of their PhD thesis including copies for the supervisors, assessment committee members, chair of the defence and PhD school at DTU Biosustain. Ordering the printed PhD theses is done through Fusion:\n\nLog into Fusion and select “Procurement” in the main menu.\nChoose “Purchase Requisitions (Search)”\nEnter “step print power” in the search field\nClick on “Step Print Power - External Store” in the search results\n\nFor the Step Print Power store, you can following the PhD thesis printing guide.

A positive final recommendation will result in the awarding of the PhD diploma to the PhD student. DTU issues a diploma to persons who have acquired the PhD degree. The diploma states the title of the thesis and the PhD school/ department where the studies took place. The diploma is issued in a combined Danish/English version. An amendment to the diploma is prepared stating the ECTS activities completed during the PhD studies. The diploma is issued when all elements of the PhD study have been completed. After the defence, it may take up to 4 months, until the PhD graduate receives their diploma. The length of this period depends on the date of the final recommendation being submitted to the central PhD administration, as well as the date of the first succeeding meeting of the relevant PhD school committee.",
