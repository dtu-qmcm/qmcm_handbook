    "text": "The submission at the end of the 3-year PhD is more than submission of the PhD thesis alone. The following documents have to prepared and submitted as well, either beforehand or simultaneously with the PhD thesis. To ensure a smooth PhD submission, the documents apart from the PhD thesis can be submitted before the hand-in date to be approved already. All documents should be submitted to the PhD school of DTU Biosustain.\n\n\nThe PhD submission checklist form has to be filled out and signed before submission together with the PhD thesis. All components of the checklist are listed below, but the checklist itself should not be forgotten.\n\n\n\nThe assessment committee approval form has to be filled out and signed before sending it to the PhD school to be approved. For the assessment committee, 3 members are required: one from DTU and two external, preferably from outside Denmark and their level should be at least assistant professor or equivalent in industry. Anyone you have collaborated and/or published with is exempt from taking part in your assessment committee. The approval form should be send for approval around 3 months before the PhD submission to allow for sufficient time for the approval, since the PhD school committee only meets once a month. It is advisable to start contacting potential assessment committee members around 6 months before your hand-in date, because it can take some time to find them. Please note that a CV and publication list of each assessment committee member are required as an attachment to the approval form.\n\n\n\nThe main chapters of the PhD thesis are usually published or unpublished manuscripts and thus require co-author statments: one per chapter/manuscript. So, the co-author statement form has to be filled out and signed separately for each chapter/manuscript with the corresponding authors. An example of a filled-out co-author statement form can be found here. Once all co-author statement forms are completed, they can be compiled into one file and submitted with the other documents for the final PhD submission.\n\n\n\nThe popular science summary will be send out with the announcement of the PhD defence, but needs to be submitted within the PhD submission.\n\n\n\nThe supervisor report goes through PhDigital and is initialised by the PhD student one month before the hand-in date. The supervisor report has to be submitted and approved before the hand-in date, so this is an important part of the PhD submission.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a few guidelines to consider for the PhD thesis itself, however most of the thesis is up to the PhD student and their preferences. Generally, the PhD thesis includes 3 main chapters which can be either published articles or unpublished manuscripts, a general introduction chapter, and a conclusions and recommendations chapter. The final chapter, i.e. conclusions and recommendations, should have the specific structure of each conclusion or recommendation as one sentence in bold with a following paragraph elaborating the conclusion or recommendation. Usually, there are 2 conclusions and 1 recommendation per chapter and the conclusions and recommendations should be in the ordered after (potential) impact. It is crucial to check the guidelines of scientific journals if published articles or unpublished manuscripts are allowed to be imbedded in the PhD thesis in their original format. PhD thesis titles need to be comprehensible and enticing to a potential reader, while at the same time not being so general and vague as to obscure what the PhD thesis is about. Furthermore, titles should be concise and informative. Abbreviations and formulae should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to include a few keywords in the title to aid web-searches. The final PhD thesis should be submitted to the PhD school of DTU Biosustain and to the supervisor team. The PhD school will forward the PhD thesis to the central PhD administration, who will send it to the assesssment committee members.\n\n\nThere is no official template for the PhD thesis document, but you can adapt the general DTU report template to fit the thesis. Official DTU logos, colours and other templates can be found in the DTU design guide. Please note that the document should be set as a two-page rather than a one-page document, since the final thesis will be printed double-sided as a book format.\n\n\n\nFor inspiration on the structure of the PhD thesis, it can be useful to refer to previous PhD theses from the DTU Biosustain department. The preface section typically uses Roman numerals as the page numbering. The first page should contain the title of the thesis, the month and year of submission, author name, the copyright and the department publishing the thesis. Following this should be a page with the written approval which should be dated and signed by the PhD student. Afterwards follows the abstract, the Danish abstract, list of publications, acknowledgements, table of contents, and list of figures and tables.\n\n\n\nFor the cover, there is a template available from the DTU design guide PhD thesis section, but most PhD students produce their own cover design. The cover should as a minimum have the DTU logo in the top left corner, the DTU department in the top right corner, the title of the PhD thesis and the name of the PhD student. Please refer to the DTU design guide logo section for the appropriate use of the DTU logo, department name, etc. The cover is allowed to be any colour, but it is important to know that the spine of the printed PhD thesis can only be selected from 12 different DTU colours. So, if you want the colour of the cover to match the colour of the spine, please refer to the colour codes in the section below in advance.\n\n\n\n\nAfter reading and assessing the PhD thesis, the assessment committee will send a preliminary approval document to the central PhD administration, which will forward it to the PhD student and the supervisors. The PhD student can officially defend their thesis after a positive preliminary recommendation, submitted to PhD school at DTU Biosustain at least two weeks prior to the scheduled defence by the central PhD administration. They will get the official approval from DTU to announce the defence. The principal supervisor arranges a date and time for the defence with the members of the assessment committee and the PhD student within 3 months of the submission of the PhD thesis and must ensure that assessment committee get at least 2 months to read the thesis. The defence takes place at DTU Biosustain, where the supervisor must book the conference room R213. In case an in-person defence is not possible for a valid reason, we are open to participate online. In case of pending patents, the PhD student might be forced to postpone the defence following directions of the Businness office at DTU Biosustain and the PhD student can defend after the patent is filed. More information about the defence proceedings can be found here.\n\n\nAnnouncement by the PhD school of DTU Biosustain of the public defence (online or at DTU) via DTU calendar and in engineering weekly Ingeniøren, and together with a summary is sent to the press presse@dtu.dk. This is all taken care of and not a responsibility of the PhD student. The PhD student should find a chairman for the defence specifically, which is typically a group leader (PI) from DTU Biosustain. The chairman of the public defence should receive the checklist for the defence proceedings, the announcement send by the PhD school of DTU Biosustain, and a PDF version of the PhD thesis.\n\n\n\nThe supervisor hosts the assessment committee and coordinates the program for their stay at DTU Biosustain on the day. This is mainly the responsibility of the supervisor, but good to know about for the PhD student.\nDTU Biosustain’s support unit will assist organising the event:\n\nReception: Hotel & flight booking read about DTU’s travel guidelines.\nEvent Coordinator Jeanette: ordering lunch and flowers for the PhD student.\nHR & Finance keepsakes that we act within DTU rules.\n\n\n\n\nThe assessment committee should claim the Honorary and travel reimbursement via e-forms. Please ask the DTU Biosustain reception unit in case Fusion support is needed. This is mainly the responsibility of the supervisor, but good to know about for the PhD student.\nClaims covered by DTU Biosustain:\n\nMaximum of 3 nights at a hotel for the examiners.\nEconomy flight ticket to Denmark.\nTaxi vouchers through DTU Biosustain reception.\nRepresentation dinner of the assessment committee members at a restaurant on the evening before the defence.\nPhD honorary for assessment members external to DTU (16 hours at a rate of 500 DKK an hour).\n\n\n\n\nThe printing of the PhD thesis is the responsibility of the PhD student, however the costs are covered by the PhD school of DTU Biosustain for a budget up to 7,000 DKK. Usually, the PhD students print around 40 copies of their PhD thesis including copies for the supervisors, assessment committee members, chair of the defence and PhD school at DTU Biosustain. Ordering the printed PhD theses is done through Fusion:\n\nLog into Fusion and select “Procurement” in the main menu.\nChoose “Purchase Requisitions (Search)”\nEnter “step print power” in the search field\nClick on “Step Print Power - External Store” in the search results\n\nFor the Step Print Power store, you can following the PhD thesis printing guide. Make sure to actually count the number of pages with colour in the PhD thesis, since this will impact the total price significantly.\nAvailable colours and corresponding CMYK codes for the spine and cover of the printed PhD thesis:\n\n\n\nAvailable spine colours\n\n\n\nDTU red (0, 91, 72, 23)\nBlack (20, 20, 10, 100)\nBlue (100, 64, 0, 0)\nDark blue (100, 90, 0, 60)\nPurple (67, 96, 0, 0)\nRed (0, 86, 65, 0)\nOrange (0, 35, 26, 0)\nPink (0, 35, 26, 0)\nYellow (0, 19, 84, 0)\nBright green (69, 0, 66, 0)\nGreen (89, 5, 100, 17)\nGrey (0, 0, 0, 20)\n\nFor the shipping on the printed PhD theses, the official address for DTU Biosustain is: Søltofts Plads, bygning 220, 2800 Lyngby. For the billing, the official EAN numbers list states the EAN number for DTU Biosustain: 5798000430297.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the public defence, the assessment committee will send the final recommendation document to the central PhD administration, who will forward it to the supervisors. A positive final recommendation will result in the awarding of the PhD diploma to the PhD student. DTU issues a diploma to persons who have acquired the PhD degree. The diploma states the title of the thesis and the PhD school/ department where the studies took place. The diploma is issued in a combined Danish/English version. An amendment to the diploma is prepared stating the ECTS activities completed during the PhD studies. The diploma is issued when all elements of the PhD study have been completed. After the defence, it may take up to 4 months, until the PhD graduate receives their diploma. The length of this period depends on the date of the final recommendation being submitted to the central PhD administration, as well as the date of the first succeeding meeting of the relevant PhD school committee.",

    "text": "Official PhD rules from DTU\nPhD information on DTU Inside\nGuidelines for PhDigital\nMain link for forms\n\n\n\nFocus solely on your PhD project plan for the first two months of your PhD, which has to be submitted to PhDigital at the end of the second month. The main part of the project plan is the project description and project overview as a Gantt chart (template), which can be added as a PDF attachment to the PhDigital project plan. The project description should contain working title, background based on literature research, hypothesis, objectives and deliverables, means and references. The project overview should be a Gantt chart containing all planned activities during the PhD project.\n\n\nFor the project plan, 25.0 ECTS have to be planned of the total 30.0 ECTS required to finish the PhD program. For the final submission at the end of the PhD program, the ECTS total has to be between 27.5 and 32.5 ECTS, otherwise the submission will be rejected. Keep this in mind when planning the courses for the project plan.\nThere are three mandatory courses and one mandatory workshop which every PhD student at DTU has to follow:\n\nSustainability Assessment and Communication for 2.5 ECTS points (register through the DTU course base using course number 12950, 12951 or 12952).\nSupervision and facilitation of learning for 1.0 ECTS point (register through the DTU Learning Lab).\nPhD Seminars in Bioengineering and Synthetic Biology for 3.0 ECTS (29903 You should attend at least 2/3 of the Friday seminar sessions and present yourself 3 times: one per year where the half-way presentation counts as one when done during the Friday seminar).\nIntroduction to responsible conduct of research and research data management for new employees workshop (register through DTU Inside).\n\nThere are many options for allocating the remaining required ECTS:\n\nOther courses at DTU which can be found and registered for through the DTU course base. Both MSc and PhD level courses are allowed, however MSc courses added to the project plan require a short written motivation.\nMultiple PhD courses available from other Danish universities which can be found through the Danish PhD courses database.\nCourses at international universities or research centers. Visit the Courses page for a full overview.\nCourses from Coursera are also allowed.\n\nWhen you want to add a non-DTU course to your project plan, a separate form with a detailed description of the ECTS activity needs to be filled out. The completed form and the course description need to be combined in one PDF file and attached to the project plan.\nYou can always add courses for approval after the submission of the project plan by adding them to your half-year reports. The registration of completed courses is done through PhDigital as well by attaching the course certification to the next half-year report and writing a note with the course name and number of ECTS that need to be registered.\n\n\n\nThe main goal of the external research stay is to experience a different research environment, so it is encouraged to go abroad. The duration of the external research stay will depend on the individual PhD project, however the average duration is three months. From three months or longer you can apply for travel grants to aid in funding the external research stay and this is also encouraged. For the project plan, you need to plan where, with whom and roughly when the external research stay will happen. Previous students have visisted different universities and companies for their external research stays, so there are many options and some examples are provided here.\n\nSystems & Synthetic Biology group of professor Lars Nielsen at the University of Queensland (UQ) in Brisbane, Australia.\nThe Systems Biology Research Group of professor Bernhard Palsson at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in San Diego, USA.\nBiosys team at the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment (INRAE) in Toulouse, France (contact through Anne Goelzer).\n\n\n\n\nFor the department work you have to plan up to 420 hours including a mandatory 100 hours for teaching. Both the teaching and other department work are allowed to be executed through all of DTU, not just the department as the name suggests. There is no dedicated way to find a teaching assistant position, so you have to ask around for it. Ask your supervisor, the PhD administration, other PhD students, etc. A 100 teaching hours corresponds with one 5.0 ECTS course at DTU. For the project plan specifically, you can write teaching assistant for 100 hours in the department work table. Additionally, there is a requirement to include a 100 hours of department work specifically for the DTU Biosustain PhD school. There are multiple options for filling up the rest of the department work hours, amongst others:\n\nCo-supervision of a student for their master thesis project, which can be allocated 200 hours for department work.\nStudent member of the PhD school committee, which can be allocated 140 hours for department work. Elections every year around the start of the year and you can contact the head of the PhD school if you are interested.\nParticipation in the Early Career Researcher Association activities, which can be allocated 20 - 200 hours for department work depending on your involvement.\n\n\n\n\nDissemination is anything related to broadcasting your research, ranging from conference posters and presentations to writing scientific publications. Up to 420 hours has to be planned for dissemination if your research. As an average, you can allocated 50 hours for conference participation and a poster or presentation, and 100 hours for writing and publishing a scientific article. Visit the Conferences page for a full overview of conferences.\n\n\n\nIt is mandatory to meet at least every two weeks with your main supervisor and on average every month with your co-supervisor(s).\n\n\n\n\nThe half-year reports have to be submitted every six months in PhDigital and are a measure to track your progress through the PhD. Select that the progress is satisfactory. For the “past six months” and “next six months” summaries, you can simple write a paragraph with an update or plan of your PhD activities, respectively. It is important to stay up-to-date with your half-year reports, since they have to be all submitted and approved before you can submit your PhD thesis in the end. Any changes in courses, external research stay, etc compared to the original PhD project plan, should be written in the half-year reports and will be approved accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe aim of the first-year interview is to improve both the PhD student and the PhD school. The interview is conducted by a scientific staff member serving on the PhD school committee. If this is not possible, another scientific staff member will be appointed to conduct the interview by agreement with the head of the PhD school. This interview is also your chance to talk through your PhD journey with a scientific staff member who is not your supervisor and this can provide you with very useful feedback. There is a guide available to help you conduct the interview.\n\n\n\nThe half-way presentation should be planned around the 18 month mark of the PhD project. Two examiners should be selected to attend the half-way presentation and the (private) discussion afterwards. One examiner should be internal from the DTU Biosustain department and one examiner should be external, preferably from outside Denmark. The discussion is attended by the main supervisor, the co-supervisor(s) and the two examiners. After the discussion, the examiners will provide feedback on the progress of the PhD project to help you prepare for the second half of the PhD. The presentation is around 20 minutes and is usually done during the PhD Friday seminars, but could be done on any day and time, depending on the availability of the examiners. It can be helpful to write a short report on your progress to send out to the supervisor team and the examiners beforehand to ensure sufficient feedback during the half-way session. Such a report can focus on background, objectives, progress and publication goals of the PhD project.\n\n\n\nIt is advisable to plan the external research stay between the 12 and 30 months mark, but it can be planned whenever it makes the most sense within the PhD project. To make the most out of the external research stay, within the first year is usually a bit too early. To avoid stress towards the end of the PhD project, the external research stay is usually planned to end before the last 6 months of the PhD project. There is no minimum requirement for the duration of the external research stay, but 3 month is the optimal for most. If you are planning to work in the laboratory at the host university or company, a duration of 6 months is more appropriate. With a duration of 3 months or longer, you can apply for travel grants to cover some of the costs of the external research stay. No need to worry, the costs of flights and the accomodation abroad is always covered by the main supervisor and the PhD school. How to book flights and process the expenses upon return can be found of the Expenses and travel page. It is recommended to start the preparations for the external research stay at least 6 months prior to leave enough time to apply for travel grants, visa, etc. For accomodation, it is possible to book an apartment through Airbnb to expand your options.\n\n\nA nice overview of travel grants can be found on the travel and research stays abroad page. An overview of all travel grants which where awarded to other PhD students in the QMCM group is provided here.\n\nOtto Mønsteds Fond applied for in October 2022 and 15,000 DKK received.

The PhD defence should take place no longer than 3 months after the PhD submission date. All information on this topic can be found on the PhD submission and defence page.\n\n\n\nThe PhD project can be extended with 3 months and the application for the extension can be submitted to the PhD school 3 months before the original hand-in date.

    "text": "Description: The Advanced Course on Multi-Omics Approaches for Improvement of Industrial Microbes aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current state-of-the-art omics technologies. It bridges different cellular levels, including metabolomics, fluxomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The course demonstrates how the integrated application of these technologies can offer holistic, quantitative insights into cellular physiology. Additionally, it shows how targets for the improvement of industrial microbes can be identified through the integration of omics data with modeling approaches.\nHeld: Annually\nECTS: 2\nProgramme Topics: - Genome sequencing and analysis - Transcriptomics (including RNA sequencing) - Proteomics - Bioinformatics - Novel molecular tools and automated strain construction - Rapid sampling and quantitative analysis - Metabolite quantification and validation using Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS) - Estimation of extra- and intracellular rates from experimental data - Kinetic modeling and approaches to handle parameter identification problems - Genomics in strain improvement (including metabolic and evolutionary engineering)\nLocation: Delft University of Technology\nVan der Maasweg 9\n2629 HZ Delft\nStudy Load: The course, including preparatory materials, is valued at 41 hours of work.\nWho Should Attend?
