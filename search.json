You will need to find a supervisor from another center at DTU that can help with the administrative stuff.\nTry asking teachers from courses with a similar topic or your head of studies.\n\n\n\nContact reception. They can add access permission to your student profile at DTU.\nYou will need to scan your DTU card every time you want to enter the building. If you want to access the building outside working hours you will need to enter the PIN of your card.\nBy default the PIN is 2800 (DTU’s postal code). You can change the PIN at DTUbasen\n\n\n\nIT has laptops for students in case you need one. Ask your master thesis supervisor at QMCM if you need one.\nFYI: The laptops that IT has for students are recycled from previous employees, and can be quite old (3+ years). I would not recommend asking for one unless you really need it.\n\n\n\n\nOne month after you start your thesis you need to submit a project plan. This document, although official, is not graded.\nThe purpose of this document is to make you think about your project and plan approximately when will you do everything. It needs to include a description of what you will be doing during the thesis and an approximate timeline.\nThe project plan does not need to be very detailed, and doesn’t need to be followed (although ideally you would follow it).",
