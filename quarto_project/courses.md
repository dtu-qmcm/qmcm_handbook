### 1. Advanced Course: Integrated Multi‚ÄêOmics Approaches for Improvement of Industrial Microbes

**Description:**
The Advanced Course on Multi-Omics Approaches for Improvement of Industrial Microbes aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current state-of-the-art omics technologies. It bridges different cellular levels, including metabolomics, fluxomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The course demonstrates how the integrated application of these technologies can offer holistic, quantitative insights into cellular physiology. Additionally, it shows how targets for the improvement of industrial microbes can be identified through the integration of omics data with modeling approaches.

**Held:** Annually

**ECTS:** 2

**Programme Topics:**
- Genome sequencing and analysis
- Transcriptomics (including RNA sequencing)
- Proteomics
- Bioinformatics
- Novel molecular tools and automated strain construction
- Rapid sampling and quantitative analysis
- Metabolite quantification and validation using Isotope Dilution Mass Spectrometry (IDMS)
- Estimation of extra- and intracellular rates from experimental data
- Kinetic modeling and approaches to handle parameter identification problems
- Genomics in strain improvement (including metabolic and evolutionary engineering)

**Location:**
Delft University of Technology  
Van der Maasweg 9  
2629 HZ Delft

**Study Load:**
The course, including preparatory materials, is valued at 41 hours of work.

**Who Should Attend?**
This Advanced Course is designed for participants from industry, universities, and research institutions who wish to update and expand their theoretical knowledge and practical insight into multi-omics and modeling. It is intended for postgraduates (MSc, EngD, PhD) with a solid background in microbiology, microbial physiology, biotechnology, biochemistry, or biochemical engineering, and a basic working knowledge in some of the other disciplines, with an affinity for applied mathematics.

### 2. Advanced Course: Metabolic Engineering & Systems Biology (MESB)

**Description:**
The advanced course in Metabolic Engineering & Systems Biology (MESB) is organized by the Systems and Synthetic Biology division at Chalmers University of Technology. It is intended for PhD students, postdocs, and industrial researchers with an interest in the computational aspects of metabolic engineering.

**Held:** Every two years

**ECTS:** 5

**Location:**
MESB24 is hosted by the Systems and Synthetic Biology group of the Department of Biology and Biological Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden.

**Aim & Content:**
The aim of the course is to provide participants with a solid foundation in various computational aspects of metabolic engineering. The course covers the following topics:
- Constraint-based genome-scale modeling
- Enzyme-constrained modeling
- Fermentation technologies
- Proteomics technologies
- RNAseq data generation and analysis
- Integrative gene-expression data analysis

A central question addressed throughout the course is: **How can I use this in my metabolic engineering project?**

**Teaching Format:**
The course is intensive and requires pre-course study of materials provided closer to the start date. Teaching during the course will be conducted through lectures, with significant time allocated in the afternoons for hands-on computer exercises.
