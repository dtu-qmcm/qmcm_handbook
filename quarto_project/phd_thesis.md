# PhD submission and defence

## Preparations (3 months before thesis submission)

The submission at the end of the 3-year PhD is more than submission of the PhD thesis alone. The following documents have to prepared and submitted as well, either beforehand or simultaneously with the PhD thesis. To ensure a smooth PhD submission, the documents apart from the PhD thesis can be submitted before the hand-in date to be approved already.

### PhD submission checklist

The [PhD submission checklist form](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/-/media/dtu-inside/undervisning/undervisningsadministration/phd-uddannelse-administratorer/skemaer/thesis-checklist.docx) has to be filled out and signed before submission together with the PhD thesis. All components of the checklist are listed below, but the checklist itself should not be forgotten.

### Approval of the assessment committee

The [assessment committee approval form](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/-/media/dtu-inside/undervisning/undervisningsadministration/phd-uddannelse-administratorer/skemaer/assessment-committee-members.pdf) has to be filled out and signed before sending it to the PhD school to be approved. For the assessment committee, 3 members are required: one from DTU and two external, preferably from outside Denmark. Anyone you have collaborated and/or published with is exempt from taking part in your assessment committee. The approval form should be send for approval around 3 months before the PhD submission to allow for sufficient time for the approval, since the PhD school committee only meets once a month. It is advisable to start contacting potential assessment committee members around 6 months before your hand-in date, because it can take some time to find them. Please note that a CV and publication list of each assessment committee member are required as an attachment to the approval form.

### Co-author statements

The main chapters of the PhD thesis are usually published or unpublished manuscripts and thus require co-author statments: one per chapter/manuscript. So, the [co-author statement form](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/-/media/dtu-inside/undervisning/undervisningsadministration/phd-uddannelse-administratorer/skemaer/co-author-statement.docx) has to be filled out and signed separately for each chapter/manuscript with the corresponding authors. An example of a filled-out co-author statement form can be found [here](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/-/media/dtu-inside/undervisning/undervisningsadministration/phd-uddannelse-administratorer/skemaer/co-author-statement-example.pdf). Once all co-author statement forms are completed, they can be compiled into one file and submitted with the other documents for the final PhD submission.

### Popular science summary

The [popular science summary](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/-/media/dtu-inside/undervisning/undervisningsadministration/phd-uddannelse-administratorer/skemaer/popular-summary.docx) will be send out with the announcement of the PhD defense, but needs to be submitted within the PhD submission.

### Supervisor report

The supervisor report goes through PhDigital and is initialised by the PhD student one month before the hand-in date. The supervisor report has to be submitted and **approved** before the hand-in date, so this is an important part of the PhD submission.
