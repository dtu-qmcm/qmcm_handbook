## PhD project plan (0 - 2 months)

Focus solely on your PhD project plan for the first two months of your PhD, which has to be submitted to PhDigital at the end of the second month. The main part of the project plan is the project description and project overview as a Gantt chart, which can be added as a PDF attachment to the PhDigital project plan. The project description should contain working title, background based on literature research, hypothesis, objectives and deliverables, means and references. The project overview should be a Gantt chart containing all planned activities during the PhD project.

### Courses

For the project plan, 25.0 ECTS have to be planned of the total 30.0 ECTS required to finish the PhD program. For the final submission at the end of the PhD program, the ECTS total has to be between 27.5 and 32.5 ECTS, otherwise the submission will be rejected. Keep this in mind when planning the courses for the project plan.

There are two mandatory courses and one mandatory workshop which every PhD student at DTU has to follow:

* Sustainability Assessment and Communication for 2.5 ECTS points (register through the [DTU course base(https://kurser.dtu.dk/)] using course number [12950](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/12950), [12951](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/12951) or [12952](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/12952))
* Supervision and facilitation of learning for 1.0 ECTS point (register through the [DTU Learning Lab](https://learninglab.dtu.dk/courses-and-events/supervision-and-facilitation-of-learning#dates--registration))
* Introduction to responsible conduct of research and research data management for new employees workshop (register through [DTU Inside](https://www.inside.dtu.dk/en/medarbejder/hr-og-arbejdsmiljoe/kompetenceudvikling/kursusoversigt_overside/kursusoversigt#?query=%7B%22Theme%22:%2235556%22,%22Role%22:%22%22,%22Language%22:%22%22,%22Cost%22:%22%22,%22SearchWord%22:%22%22,%22SortOn%22:%22%22,%22MaxRecords%22:10%7D))

There are many options for allocating the remaining required ECTS:

* Good-quality courses at DTU which can be found and registered for through the [DTU course base(https://kurser.dtu.dk/)]. Both MSc and PhD level courses are allowed, however MSc courses added to the project plan require a short written motivation.
* Multiple PhD courses available from other Danish universities which can be found through the [Danish PhD courses database](https://phdcourses.dk/).
* Courses at international universities or research centers. Visit the [Courses](courses.md) page for a full overview.
* Courses from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) are also allowed.

When you want to add a non-DTU course to your project plan, a separate [form](Description-ECTS-activity_template.docx) with a detailed description of the ECTS activity needs to be filled out. The completed form and the course description need to be combined in one PDF file and attached to the project plan.
