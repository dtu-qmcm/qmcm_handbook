# Acknowledgements

If you present a poster, submit a paper or do a talk in an outside venue, you should remember to acknowledge whoever funded your research.

QMCM is funded by two major grants: NNF Warburg (grant number NNF14OC0009473) and [DIGIBIO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101060066). Check which one(s) apply to you!

DIGIBIO is an EU Horizons grant, which has some extra acknowledgement requirements. Specifically, your poster, paper or presentation should include an EU logo consisting of the flag plus the statement "Funded by the European Union".
