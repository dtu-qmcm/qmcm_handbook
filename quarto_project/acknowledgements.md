# Acknowledgements

If you present a poster, submit a paper or do a talk in an outside venue, you should remember to acknowledge whoever funded your research.

QMCM is funded by two major grants: NNF Warburg and DIGIBIO. Check which one(s) apply to you!

DIGIBIO is an EU Horizons grant, which has some extra acknowledgement requirements:
